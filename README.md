## TL;DR

I convert some jar applications to `.app` using dante-biase's [jar2app](https://github.com/dante-biase/jar2app). 

They can work well on arm/x86_64 macOS with your JDK(So you must install JDK yourself). You can download them in the release.

App lists:
|App Name|Intro|
|-------|-----|
|[jd-gui](https://github.com/java-decompiler/jd-gui)|Java Decompiler|
|[LogiSim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)|Logic circuits simulator|
|[LogiSim-Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution)|Logisim's evolution|
|StegSolve| CTF Steg problems' solver|

## Detail
In macOS, the elegant way to run a jar file is packing it to an app file, since many developers build their java applications in this way.

Also, there are many simple way to package the `.jar` file like [jar2app](https://github.com/Jorl17/jar2app) and another [jar2app](https://github.com/dante-biase/jar2app).

The first one does not support arm natively, but the second can do due to its simple principle.

So I convert these applications' .jar files to .app using dante-biase's [jar2app](https://github.com/dante-biase/jar2app). You can download them in the release.

For all that, I highly recommend you convert it by yourself. It's not so hard, just read [jar2app](https://github.com/dante-biase/jar2app)'s README and one-line command.
